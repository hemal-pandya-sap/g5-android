# Description

This is a sample Android project that demonstrates how Android Apps using SAP BTP SDK for Android and running on older devices can be modified to connect to BTP domains on G5 Certificate. It connects to my app, which will remain accessible for some time. Even if the mobile app is not available, the sample should help modify other android apps.
